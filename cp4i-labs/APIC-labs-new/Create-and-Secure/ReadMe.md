# 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In this lab, we will get a chance to use the IBM API Connect (APIC) Designer and its intuitive interface to import and edit an API using the OpenAPI definition (YAML) of an existing Customer Database RESTful web service.

In this tutorial, we will explore the following key capabilities:

-   Creating an API by importing an OpenAPI definition for an existing REST service

-   Configuring ClientID/Secret Security, endpoints, and proxy to invoke an endpoint

-   Testing a REST API in the developer toolkit

-   Publish an API for developers

# 2. Import an API into the Developer Workspace <a name="import_api"></a>

If you're not logged before, follow these instructions to access to the API Manager ->
[Login to the API Manager](../Login-apic/ReadMe.md)

1\. Confirm that you are in the provider organization for your username (upper right) and then click on **Develop APIs and products**.

![alt text][pic9]

2\. We are now able to begin to create APIs and Products.  Click **Add**.

![alt text][pic10]

3\. Click **API (from REST, GraphQL or SOAP)**.

![alt text][pic11]

4\. Click **From existing OpenAPI service ** under **Create** and click **Next**.

![alt text][pic12]

5\. Download the **Customer_Database-1.0.0.yaml** file for an existing REST service [here](./resources/Customer_Database-1.0.0.yaml).

6\. Drag and drop the yaml file that you just downloaded or click to upload. Once you have dragged and dropped or uploaded, you will see the yaml file listed under and should see a notification that the "YAML has been successfully validated". Click **Next**.

![alt text][pic13]

7\. Review the basic info for the API and click **Next**. 

![alt text][pic105]

8\. Make sure that the **Activate API** <span style="color: red">is not</span> selected and click **Next**. 

![alt text][pic14]

9\.  The API should be imported successfully as shown in the image below.  Click **Edit API**.

# 3. Configure the API <a name="configure_api"></a>

After importing the existing API, it is already configured with basic Client Id API Key security for consumer identification. Now we are going to add extra security before exposing it to other developers so that we are able to authenticate the application using the API.

Next, we will review the backend endpoints where the API is actually running. IBM API Connect supports pointing to multiple backend endpoints to match your multiple build stage environments.

Finally, we will review the proxy call to invoke the endpoint.

## 3a. Configure Client Secret API Key Security <a name="configure_security"></a>

1\. Make sure that the **Design** tab is selected and click on the **+** next to **Security Schemes**.

![alt text][pic31]

12\. For the **Security Definition Name (Key)**, enter a name (e.g., **ClientSecret**) and select **apiKey** in the drop-down menu for **Security Definition Type**.

![alt text][pic32]

13\. Select **client_secret** from the drop-down menu for **Key Type (optional)**, and select **header** from the drop-down menu for **Located In**. For the **Variable Name**, enter a name (e.g., **X-IBM-Client-Secret**). Click **Create**.

![alt text][pic33]

14\. Click **Save**.

![alt text][pic26]

15\. Once saved, you will see an indicator window appear that shows that **Your API has been updated**.  Click on the **X** to close the window.

![alt text][pic22]

16\. Make sure that the **Design** tab is selected. Click on the **Security** section and then click on the **pencil** icon to edit the existing security configuration

![alt text][pic34]

# 5. Publish API <a name="publish_api"></a>

In this lab, we will make the API available to developers. In order to do so, the API must be first put into a product and then published to the Sandbox catalog. A product dictates rate limits and API throttling.

When the product is published, the Invoke policy defined in the previous lab is written to the gateway. 

## 5a. Create Customer Product and Add API <a name="customer_product"></a>

1\. From the vertical navigation menu on the left, click **Develop**.

![alt text][pic80]

2\. Click the **Products** tab.

![alt text][pic82]

3\. Click **Add** and click **Product** from the drop-down menu.

![alt text][pic83]

![alt text][pic84]

4\. Click **New product** and click **Next**.

![alt text][pic85]

5\. Enter **Customer** for the **Title** and click **Next**.

![alt text][pic86]

6\. Select the **Customer Database** API and click **Next**.

![alt text][pic87]

7\. Keep the **Default Plan** as is and click **Next**.

![alt text][pic88]

8\. Select **Publish product** and confirm that **Visibility** is set to **Public** and **Subscribability** is set to **Authenticated**.  Click **Next**.

![alt text][pic89]

9\.  The Product is now published successfully with the API base URL listed and available for developers from the Developer Portal.  Click **Done**.
