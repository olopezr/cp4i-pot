# 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In an event-driven flow you identify an event that can occur in your source application and actions that can be performed in one or more target applications. The flow is triggered when the event occurs.
* The purpose of this LAB is to show how to create an event-driven flow to identify when new Salesforce Account Records are created. 

When prompted to log in to CP4I use the username and password provided to you for this lab.   

# 2. Setup connection to Smart connectors for this lab.<a name="Setup_connections"></a>

In this section we use App Connect Designer to create a flow that is triggered when an event occurs on Salesforce records.

1\. Use the URL that was provided to you for the cluster you will be using.   Select the Enterprise LDAP

2\. When prompted use the username and password provided to you for this lab. In this example we are using wedge15.

3\. You will now be on your home page and it the upper left it will show your login name.   Under Integrations click on the App Connect Designer link to take you to the designer dashboard.

![alt text][pic2]

4\. In the upper left always make sure you are in the correct namespace.  Select the tab on the left to open the Catalog screen.

![alt text][pic3]

5\. Now scroll down to the Salesforce connector and click on the Connect button.  We are setting up our Salesforce connector here first but this also can be done with in the flow as you are building it. 
* **Note:** if you already have a Account connected for Salesforce skip to step 8

![alt text][pic4]

6\. Fill in the Salesforce connection info that you have from the pre-lab section at the beginning of this lab. 

![alt text][pic5]

7\. You will see the events and actions availble with this connector. Also you can change the Account Name to something more meaningful to you by clicking on the 3 dots next to the Account name. 

![alt text][pic6]

8\. For the this lab we will use MQ as our target applications.  The initial MQ setup should be done before starting labs since several labs use MQ and this will disable MQ security and get you the hostname of the MQ QMgr running under your cluster-id.  If you didn't complete this you can go back to the pre-lab setup to complete it here:
**[Initial MQ setup](../../MQ-Pre-Lab/MQ-Pre-Lab.md)**

9\. Now go back to the tab where you signed into CP4I and click on the top IBM Automation to get to the home page.   Then right click your qmgr and open in a new tab.  

![alt text][pic6f]

10\. Now save the name of your QMgr and click on the tile to open that Qmgr dashboard.

![alt text][pic6g]

11\. Now we will create a new Queue to use in our new flow

![alt text][pic6h]

12\. We will be creating a new Local queue.  

![alt text][pic6i]

13\. Enter the name for the Queue.  In the example we used "SALESFORCE.ACCOUNT.EVENT" then click Create.  

![alt text][pic6j]

14\. Now go back to the tab with the App Connect Designer and select the catalog on the left menu. Scroll down to IBM MQ and fill in the connection info.  
* Enter the QMgr name
* For the QMgr host we will use the **(service-name).(namespace).svc**
* Port is 1414
* Channel SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN

Salesforce New Account Events. 

![alt text][pic9]

4\. Click on the first Blue + and scroll down to Salesforce connector.   Select New account under Accounts.  

![alt text][pic10]

5\. Now we show the Salesforce connector.  Click on the next Blue + and scroll down to IBM MQ.  Select the Put message action.

![alt text][pic11]


6\. Now enter the Queue Name you created for MQ.  We used SALESFORCE.ACCOUNT.EVENT
* For Message type select Text
* For the Message payload click on the insert mapping and you will have a list of Suggested mappings.  Scroll down and select the Account Name.

![alt text][pic12]

7\. Now we are ready to start the flow.  In the upper right corner click on the 3-dots and start the flow.  

![alt text][pic13]

8\. Now return to the tab where you have the MQ console opened.  Click on manged and you should see your new Queue.  It should be showing 0/5000 which means it has no messages and can handle 5000 messages. 
* This is where we will check when we test this flow.

![alt text][pic24]


4\. Fill-in the new Account info.  You will need a Account Name and website and then click  **Save**

![alt text][pic25]

5\. Now we will go back to the MQ console to check for messages on our Queue from this event.   

![alt text][pic26]

5\. You will now see that it shows 1/5000 which means we have a new message.  Click on the Queue to see the message.  Remeber in the mapping of the flow we put the Account Name in the Message body so you should see that here.

# 5. Deploying Your Designer Flow to App Connect Dashboard <a name="deploy_a_designer_flow"></a>

As in other labs we can export our Designer flow as a bar file and deploy to App Connect Dashboard on Cloud Pak for Integration. We will not do that in this lab.
