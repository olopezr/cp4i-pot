## Introduction
These labs will cover both the ACE Toolkit and ACE Designer to build integrations. We will be creating APIs with Designer and then also import them into APIC.   Will also cover labs on the Asset Repository and Operations Dashboard for tracing.

|  Subject                            | Description                                            |                                                               
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 1](Lab_1/ReadMe.md)       | **Basic PING flow with Toolkit** This is a basic toolkit lab that you will create a simple Ping flow and then test locally and deploy to the ACE runtime in CP4I. 
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 2](Lab_2/ReadMe.md)       | **Callable Flows** The purpose of this LAB is to show the configuration needed to distribute workloads using IBM App Connect Enterprise Callable Flows.
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 3a](Lab_3a/ReadMe.md)       | **Build Salesforce API in minutes** The purpose of this LAB is to show how to retrieve Salesforce Account Records using IBM App Connect Designer on IBM Cloud Pak for Integration. **Need to complete [SF-Pre-Lab](SF-Pre-Lab/SF-Pre-Lab.md) before starting this Lab** 
|-------------------------|
| [Lab 3b](Lab_3b/ReadMe.md)       | **Expose your Salesforce API in APIC** This lab we will take the API created in lab 3a and expose it in IBM API connect.  APIC is an integrated API management offering, where all of the steps in the API lifecycle, and the actions that surround it, are performed within the offering.
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 3c](Lab_3c/ReadMe.md)       | **Build Salesforce Event Driven flow** The purpose of this LAB is to show how to react to updates to Salesforce Account Records being created and updated  using IBM App Connect Designer on IBM Cloud Pak for Integration. **Need to complete [SF-Pre-Lab](SF-Pre-Lab/SF-Pre-Lab.md) before starting this Lab** 
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 4a](Lab_4a/ReadMe.md)       | **Build ServiceNow API in minutes** The purpose of this LAB is to show how to retrieve ServiceNow User Records using IBM App Connect Designer on IBM Cloud Pak for Integration. **Need to complete [SNow-Pre-Lab](SNow-Pre-Lab/SNow-Pre-Lab.md) before starting this Lab** 
|-------------------------|
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 4b](Lab_4b/ReadMe.md)       | **Expose your ServiceNow API in APIC** This lab we will take the API created in lab 4a and expose it in IBM API connect.  APIC is an integrated API management offering, where all of the steps in the API lifecycle, and the actions that surround it, are performed within the offering.
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 4c](Lab_4c/ReadMe.md)       | **Build ServiceNow Event Driven flow** The purpose of this LAB is to show how to react to updates to ServiceNow Account Records being created and updated  using IBM App Connect Designer on IBM Cloud Pak for Integration. **Need to complete [SNow-Pre-Lab](SNow-Pre-Lab/SNow-Pre-Lab.md) before starting this Lab** 
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 5](Lab_5/ReadMe.md)       |**Introduction to Asset Repository** The purpose of this lab is to provide an introduction to the Asset Repository. The Asset Repository is an add-on to the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration that allows the user to store, manage, retrieve and search integration assets within the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration and its capabilities.
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 6](Lab_6/ReadMe.md)       |**Introduction to Operations Dashboard** The purpose of this lab is to provide an introduction to the Operations Dashboard. The IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Operations Dashboard Add-on provides cross-component transaction tracing to allow troubleshooting and investigating errors and latency issues across integration capabilities to ensure applications meet service level agreements.  This lab will leverage the integration capabilities of IBM API Connect, IBM App Connect Enterprise, and IBM MQ. 
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 7](Lab_7/ReadMe.md)       |**Event Driven flows** The purpose of this lab is to provide an introduction Kafka labs using Toolkit Kafka nodes to create producers and consumers of Kafka messages using Event Steams 
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Lab 8](Lab_8/ReadMe.md)       |**Event Driven flows** The purpose of this lab is to provide an introduction Kafka using Designer Smart connectors to create producers and consumers of Kafka messages using Event Steams
