# 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to the Asset Repository. The Asset Repository is a component of IBM Cloud Pak for Integration that allows the user to store, manage, retrieve and search integration assets within the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration and its capabilities.

Users of IBM Cloud Pak for Integration are able to use the Asset Repository to share Integration assets across the platform capabilities. Storing assets, such as JSON schemas, within this repository allows them to be accessed directly within the user interface of certain Integration capabilities. For example, an OpenAPI specification asset stored in the repository can be directly imported within the IBM API Connect user interface.

Assets can also be located in remote repositories, such as Git. This allows users to take advantage of the versioning capability offered by the remote repository. **Note:** Assets stored in a remote repository are read-only.

Users gain access to the Asset Repository through membership in one or more teams that have access to the repository.

# 2. Creating a Designer Flow in IBM Cloud Pak for Integration <a name="creating_a_designer_flow_in_cp4i"></a>

In this section, we will use App Connect Designer to create a simple flow that will be exposed as an API.

1\. In a browser, enter the URL for the Platform Navigator that is provided by your instructor.

2\. Select the **Enterprise LDAP**:

![alt text][pic4]

3\. When prompted, use the username and password provided to you for this lab. The username in the screenshots of this lab is chopper2.

![alt text][pic5]

4\. Click on the App Connect Designer link to take you to the designer dashboard.  This should be suffixed with des with your username that you used to sign in with ace-designer-ai<span style="color: red">**username number**</span>. In this example, the App Connect Designer link is called ace-designer-ai2. **Note:** Make sure that you see your username number as the suffix.  If not, please notify your instructor.

If you have completed previous IBM Cloud Pak for Integration App Connect labs, the designer dashboard will be familiar to you. The App Connect Designer capability provides an IBM App Connect authoring environment for integration flows.

**Note:** If you get a warning message that your connection is not private, follow the instructions in Step 2.

![alt text][pic6]

5\. In this lab, we will be creating a simple API flow.  In the designer dashboard, select **Create flows for an API**.  **Note:** In the screenshots that follow, chopper2 was used to login.

**Note:** If you prefer, you can use a flow that you created in one of the App Connect labs.  If you use a flow that is already created, you can skip to Section 4.

![alt text][pic7]

6\. The first thing that we will do is create the model for this. We will call the model **HelloWorld**. Also in the upper left, we will change the Name from **Untitled** to **HelloWorld-<span style="color: red">username</span>**. In the example below, the username is chopper2. You will want to replace chopper2 with your username. Click **Create model**.

![alt text][pic8]

7\. We will map the following property which is data type String. If you have a property that contains a numerical integer value, you could also set the data type to Number.

* Description

Now that we have defined the properties in our API model definition, we can implement a flow by clicking on the **Operations** tab.

![alt text][pic9]

8\. From the **Operations** drop-down menu, select **Add a custom operation**. Here we will customize the operation that we want our API to perform.

![alt text][pic10]

9\. Customize the details of your API operation. **Note:** You can optionally set a description for your individual API operation.
#
- Display Name: **Sample Flow**
- HTTP Verb: **GET**
- Operation Name: **test**
- Response body: **HelloWorld**

**Note:** The operation name will be a part of your API Endpoint URL and is therefore consumer-facing.

After customizing your API operation, the details should match the image below.

![alt text][pic11]

10\. Now we can click the **Implement Flow** button next to our API operation definition. This will take us to the App Connect Designer flow.

![alt text][pic12]

11\. This we where we can utilize the in-built Smart Mapping feature provided by IBM App Connect Designer. Since we are just building a simple flow, we will not be leveraging the Smart Mapping feature.  If you were leveraging a connectors (e.g. ServiceNow or Salesforce), Smart Mapping grabs all the fields available from an external object.

Click on the **Response** action.

![alt text][pic13]

12\. In the **Response** action, we will define a default value of **Hello World!!!** for the **description** field.

![alt text][pic14]

13\. Click **Done**. This will take you back to the main page for this API.

![alt text][pic15]

14\. Slide the toggle switch next to **Stopped**. It will change from Stopped to Starting.

![alt text][pic16]

15\. Once it shows Started, click on **Test** on the menu and continue to next section.

# 2a. Testing the API flow <a name="testing_the_API_flow"></a>

Make sure your API is running by checking the upper pane of your Designer instance. Since App Connect Designer has a built-in REST API testing utility, we will leverage it in this lab.

1\. Now select the **GET** operation on the left menu and review the information on this API we just created. You should be able to see the Details pane describing the properties and parameters of your REST API operation. The full URL endpoint for your Designer flow is also displayed.

![alt text][pic18]

2\. Now click on the **Try It** button.

![alt text][pic19]

3\. Scroll down and click on the **Send** button.

![alt text][pic20]

4\. This will trigger an API call to your Designer flow and in turn populate a Request and Response pane below the Send button. You will see the default value of **Hello World!!!** in the **Description** field.

# 3. Export Your Designer Flow As Deployable BAR File <a name="export_your_designer_flow_as_bar_file"></a>

Now we can export our Designer flow from the App Connect Designer as a deployable asset.

1\. Navigate to your App Connect Designer so we can export our flow as a BAR file. We can get to the App Connect Designer Dashboard by clicking the **Dashboard** icon on the left-hand pane.

![alt text][pic22]

2\. After navigating to the Dashboard, click on the triple-dot icon on your Designer flow.

![alt text][pic23]

3\. Click on **Export**.

![alt text][pic24]

4\. Select **Runtime flow asset (BAR)**. This will allow you to download the BAR file to your local directory.  Click **Export** and save the file for further use.

# 4. Populating the Asset Repository <a name="populating_asset_repository"></a>

As mentioned, the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Asset Repository is an add-on to the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I) that allows the user to store, manage, retrieve and search integration assets within the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration and its capabilities.

Users of the Cloud Pak are able to utilize the Asset Repository to share integration assets across the platform capabilities. Storing assets, e.g. JSON schemas, within this repository allows them to be accessed directly within the user interface of certain Integration capabilities. For example, an OpenAPI specification asset stored in the repository can be directly imported within the IBM API Connect user interface.

In this lab, you will store a .yaml and a .bar file in the repository.

# 4a. Storing a YAML File in the Asset Repository <a name="yaml_asset_repository"></a>
